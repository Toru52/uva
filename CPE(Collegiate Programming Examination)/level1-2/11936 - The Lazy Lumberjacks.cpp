Once upon a time in a far, far away forest, there was a team 
of lazy lumberjacks. Since they were too lazy to cut trees, 
they were always figuring out ways to sneak out of work. 
Their foreman, on the other side, was always trying to put 
them all to work.
After a lot of discussions the foreman and the lumberjacks 
came to an agreement: they will work, but only if the area of 
the forest assigned to each one was a triangle. 
If it was any other shape they will be free not to work that 
week. The idea was to give each lumberjack three numbers 
representing the length of each of the triangles side. 
If the numbers were correct and form a triangle, 
the lumberjacks had to work, else, they were free to leave 
and not work. Since our lumberjacks are as cunning as they 
are lazy, they convince the foreman to let them determine the 
surface and the site in the forest were they will work. 
As a result, the lumberjacks keep passing the foreman sets 
of numbers that could not form the sides of a triangle. 
After a while, the foreman began to suspect and decide to 
write a program that validates the input of each lumberjack.
Now when the lumberjacks decide to pass wrong numbers 
they get a fine of $1000.00 (more than a day’s salary).
Your job is to write the program that the foreman has to use 
to determine if the numbers (all integers) passed by the 
lumberjacks can be the sides of a triangle. If they can, 
you have to print ‘OK’ else you have to print ‘Wrong!!’



Input
The input consist in a data set describing the numbers of 
that each lumberjack has passed to the
foreman for the day. The data is formatted as follows:
The first line is an integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 20). Then follows N 
lines, each one containing three integers separated by a space.
Output
For each line in the input you have to find if the integers 
can represent the sides of a triangle. If they
can you have to print ‘OK’ for each line in the input, 
else you have to print ‘Wrong!!’



Sample Input

1 2 3
3 2 5
3 4 5
6 6 1
3 3 3
7 3 10

Sample Output
Wrong!!
Wrong!!
OK
OK
OK
Wrong!!
