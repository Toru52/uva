Cryptanalysis is the process of breaking someone elseâ€™s 
cryptographic writing. This sometimes involves some kind 
of statistical analysis of a passage of (encrypted) text. 
Your task is to write a program which performs a simple 
analysis of a given text.



Input
The first line of input contains a single positive decimal 
integer n. This is the number of lines which follow in 
the input. The next n lines will contain zero or more 
characters (possibly including whitespace).This is the 
text which must be analyzed.

Output
Each line of output contains a single uppercase letter, 
followed by a single space, then followed by a positive 
decimal integer. The integer indicates how many times 
the corresponding letter appears in the input text. 
Upper and lower case letters in the input are to be 
considered the same. No other characters must be counted. 
The output must be sorted in descending count order; 
that is, the most frequent letter is on the first output 
line, and the last line of output indicates the least 
frequent letter.If two letters have the same frequency, 
then the letter which comes first in the alphabet must 
appear first in the output. If a letter does not appear 
in the text, then that letter must not appear in the output.
