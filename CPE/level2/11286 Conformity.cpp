Frosh commencing their stud-
ies at Waterloo have diverse
interests, as evidenced by
their desire to take vari-
ous combinations of courses
from among those available.
University administrators
are uncomfortable with this
situation, and therefore wish
to offer a conformity prize
to frosh who choose the
most popular combination of
courses. How many frosh
will win the prize?



Input
The input consists of several test cases followed by a line containing `0'. 
Each test case begins with an integer 1  n  10000, 
the number of frosh. For each frosh, a line follows containing the course
numbers of ve distinct courses selected by the frosh. 
Each course number is an integer between 100 and 499.
The popularity of a combination is the number of frosh selecting exactly 
the same combination of courses. 
A combination of courses is considered most popular if no other 
combination has higher popularity.

Output
For each line of input, you should output a single line giving the total 
number of students taking some
combination of courses that is most popular.
