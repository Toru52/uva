The well known Fibonacci sequence is obtained by 
starting with 0 and 1 and then adding the two last
numbers to get the next one. For example the third 
number in the sequence is 1 (1=1+0), the forth is
2 (2=1+1), the fifth is 3 (3=2+1) and so on.
      i 0 1 2 3 4 5 6  7  8  9
F ib(i) 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
Figure 1 - The first numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
The sequence appears on many things in our life, in 
nature, and has a great significance.Among other things, 
do you know that all positive integer numbers can be 
represented as a sum of numbers in the Fibonacci 
sequence? More than that, all positive integers can be 
represented as a sum of a set of Fibonacci numbers, 
that is, numbers from the sequence, without repetition.
 For example: 13 can be the sum of the sets 
 {13}, {5,8} or {2,3,8} and 17 is represented by 
 {1,3,13} or {1,3,5,8}. 
Since all numbers have this property (do you want to 
try to prove this for yourself?) this set could be a
nice way to use as a "base" to represent the number. 
But, as we have seen, some numbers have more than one 
set whose sum is the number. How can we solve that? 
Simple! If we add the constraint that the sets cannot 
have two consecutive Fibonacci numbers, than we have a 
unique representation for each number! This 
restriction is because the sum of any two consecutive 
Fibonacci numbers is just the following Fibonacci 
number.Now that we know all this we can prepare a nice 
way to represent any positive integer. We will use
a binary sequence (just zeros and ones) to do that. 
For example, 17 = 1 + 3 + 13 (remember that no two 
consecutive Fibonacci numbers can be used). 
Let’s write a zero for each Fibonacci number that is
not used and one for each one that is used, starting 
at the right. Then, 17 = 100101. See figure 2 for a
detailed explanation. In this representation we should 
not have zeros at the left, this is, we should only
write starting with the first one. In order for you to 
understand better, note that in this scheme, not using 
two consecutive Fibonacci numbers means that the 
binary sequence will not have two consecutive ones. 
When we use this representation for a number we say 
that we are using the Fibonaccimal base, and we write 
it like 17 = 100101 (fib).
    17 =  1 0 0 1 0 1
13+3+1 = 13 8 5 3 2 1

Fibonaccimal base Given a set of numbers in decimal 
base, your task is to write them in the Fibonaccimal 
base.



Input
The first line of input contains a single number N, 
representing the quantity of numbers that follow
(1 ≤ N ≤ 500).
Than follow exactly N lines, each one containing a 
single positive integer smaller than 100 000 000.
These numbers can come in any order.

Output
You should output a single line for each of the N 
integers in the input, with the format ‘DEC BASE
= F IB BASE (fib)’. DEC BASE is the original number in 
decimal base and F IB BASE is its
representation in Fibonaccimal base. See the sample 
output for an example.
