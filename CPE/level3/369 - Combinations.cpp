Computing the exact number of ways that N things can be taken M at a 
time can be a great challenge when N and/or M become very large. 
Challenges are the stuff of contests. Therefore, you are to make
just such a computation given the following:
GIVEN:
5  N  100; and 5  M  100; and M  N
Compute the EXACT value of:
C =
N!
(N ô€€€M)! M!
You may assume that the final value of C will fit in a 32-bit Pascal 
LongInt or a C long.
For the record, the exact value of 100! is:
93,326,215,443,944,152,681,699,238,856,266,700,490,715,968,264,381,621,
468,592,963,895,217,599,993,229,915,608,941,463,976,156,518,286,253,
697,920,827,223,758,251,185,210,916,864,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000



Input
The input to this program will be one or more lines each containing 
zero or more leading spaces, a value for N, one or more spaces, 
and a value for M. The last line of the input file will contain a 
dummy N,M pair with both values equal to zero. Your program should 
terminate when this line is read.

Output
The output from this program should be in the form:
N things taken M at a time is C exactly.



Sample Input
100 6
20 5
18 6
0 0

Sample Output
100 things taken 6 at a time is 1192052400 exactly.
20 things taken 5 at a time is 15504 exactly.
18 things taken 6 at a time is 18564 exactly.
